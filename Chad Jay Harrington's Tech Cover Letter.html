    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>I am very interested in any positions you may have available. With my experience in technical service, the
computer industry, and my dedication to succeed I am super enthusiastic to exceed everyone's expectations
which makes me an excellent candidate for any job position.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about the computer industry, and interested in increasing my employment value in all
aspects. I've been professionally involved in the computer industry for about 18 years, and technical
support/customer service for about 8 years. Since I was about 12 years old I’ve been interested in software
engineering; however, since I wasn’t a legal adult I began shadowing tech agents at the I.S. department of
Longmont United Hospital. I am an entrepreneur who has started many businesses and I operate my own
contracting and consulting entity for computer repair and web development. Since attending CU-Boulder for
Electrical and Computer Engineering I found that many of the classes I was taking were very basic compared
to my skill level. I am currently taking a JavaScript programming class, and am researching React.js, Angular,
TypeScript, and am looking into the future of web applications for my career.</p>
        <p>I would enjoy handling responsibilities at any capacity and very much am lookin forward to speaking with you
in the near future. If you need any additional information regarding my qualifications, I can be reached at
720-204-8509. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br/><br/></p>

        <p>Chad Harrington</p>
